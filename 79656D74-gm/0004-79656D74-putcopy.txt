## Field data

None.

This extension block SHOULD appear no more than once.

## Description

This extension adds one OOP command to the language:

* `#putcopy <todir> <fromdir> <pushdir> [<startlabel>]`: Duplicate the tile with suitable stats at `<fromdir>` to `<todir>`, sending it to `<startlabel>` bypassing lock status if the argument is provided.

Duplication behaves identically to how a duplicator behaves, except a sound effect MUST NOT be played as a result of duplication or failing to duplicate. `<pushdir>` is used as the push direction where needed.

If `<pushdir>` is `IDLE` or `I`, then one SHOULD also have the 00000001:0004 "FIX: Crash when element is recursively pushing itself" extension, and in fact one really should have extension that anyway.

Failure to duplicate is ignored.

`<startlabel>` is sent to the first stat found at `<todir>` if it exists. Sending `<startlabel>` behaves identically to executing `#send <startlabel>` as if it were executed on the target stat, ignoring the lock on the stat.

A further elaboration: Because duplication behaves identically to how a duplicator behaves, `#putcopy` with a `<fromdir>` pointing to a player clone will perform an element touch on whatever's at `<todir>`.

## Compatibility

If this extension block is absent:

* `#putcopy <todir> <fromdir> <pushdir> [<startlabel>]` MUST be hidden.

## Rationales

This eliminates needing to actually use a duplicator for a lot of things, complete with its slowness and its inability to be moved around.

This also covers the case where someone wants to implement something like MegaZeux's `duplicate self <dir>` without having to actually use a duplicator.

Basically, duplicators kinda suck, let's make them unnecessary.

Best paired with 79656D74:0001 "`by`/`at` parameterised directions" as usual.
